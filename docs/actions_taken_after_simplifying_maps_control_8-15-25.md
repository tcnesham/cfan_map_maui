## Actions taken after simplifying maps control â€” 2025-08-15

### actions taken
- Ran a Debug Android build to surface remaining migration errors after switching to Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps.
- Fixed bounds usage in `ViewModels/MapBaseVM.cs`:
  - Replaced `bounds.Northeast/Southwest` with the correct `bounds.NorthEast/SouthWest`.
  - Computed bounds center and radius (meters) and used `MapControl.MoveToRegion(MapSpan.FromCenterAndRadius(...))` to zoom to country.
- Rebuilt: compile now succeeds for `net9.0-android`.

### status
- Build: PASS (Debug, net9.0-android).
- Warnings: Nullability and legacy custom map wrapper warnings remain but are non-blocking.
- Maps: Using `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps` exclusively; pages and VMs compile with MAUI types where needed.

### next steps
- Optional emulator smoke test: open School/Market maps, verify borders and auto-zoom, add/select pins, and test Navigate action.
- Gradually remove GoogleMaps camera constructs (CameraUpdate/CameraPosition) and rely solely on `MoveToRegion`.
- Triage and reduce warnings in hot paths (nullability, obsolete APIs).

### requirements coverage
- Keep Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps as the only maps package: Done.
- Restore a successful Android build after migration: Done.
